# Full 16-Bit Computer Architecture and Toolchain from Scratch

This project is a complete implementation of a 16-bit computer system built from the ground up, inspired by the book Elements of Computing System. It includes both hardware and software components, simulating a full computing stack from logic gates to a working operating system.

## Features

- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Memory Modules (RAM, ROM, Registers)
- Two-pass Assembler for translating Hack Assembly to machine code
- Virtual Machine (VM) translator to translate VM code to assembly
- Compiler for a high-level language
- Operating System (OS) with core utilities and services

## Technologies Used

- **HDL** – Hardware simulation language
- **Hack Assembly** – Low-level language for Hack computer
- **Java** – For implementing the assembler, VM translator, compiler, and OS components
